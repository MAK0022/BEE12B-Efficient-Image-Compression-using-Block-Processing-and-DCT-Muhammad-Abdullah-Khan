Abstract: This project focuses on implementing an efficient image compression algorithm using block processing and the discrete cosine transform (DCT) for digital signal processing (DSP) systems. 
The algorithm aims to reduce image file sizes while maintaining acceptable image quality. The image is divided into blocks, and the DCT is applied to each block to extract its frequency coefficients.
Quantization is then performed to discard insignificant coefficients, resulting in further data reduction. The compressed image can be reconstructed by applying inverse operations, including inverse quantization and inverse DCT. 
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in achieving image compression with reasonable image quality.
